Hello, my name is Daniil. Thank you for your time to check the project!

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone the project

```bash
HTTPS: https://github.com/Danik711/search-movie.git

SSH: git@github.com:Danik711/search-movie.git
```
## Step 2: Install all dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Start Metro Server
Start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```

### For iOS

```bash
npm run ios
```
This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see Home Screen that is going to display movies and a search bar at the top.
